# Mass Shooting Fatalities
A data-driven audio + animation experiment representing the loss of life due to mass shootings in the United States since 1997. The data in `input/data` comes from Mother Jones' [mass shootings investigation](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data).

This project is based on two previous projects: [midi-shootings](https://github.com/julia67/midi-shootings) and [animated-data-sonification](https://github.com/julia67/animated-data-sonification).

**Demo:** [The last 20 years of mass shooting fatalities](http://julia-smith.com/shooting-fatalities)
